Q4 Design and write REST API with express/nodejs to support CRUD operation to manage
a list of users, Assume the user is defined as following:
User = {
Id: string
Name: string
Email: string
}
And we can manage the users in memory, if you can sketch the code to work with
mongodb that would be a plus but not required
The operations we want to support are add/remove user, get user by id, query user by
name or email.

Project Installation:
- Run this command to install all dependencies `npm install`
- Run this command to start up the application: `npm start`
- Application starts up by default on port 4300 but can be modified via by the .env file
